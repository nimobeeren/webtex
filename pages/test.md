# Distribution of Computation

Let $R$ be a collection of records in a data set, ${A = \{a_1, a_2, ..., a_k, ...\}}$ be a set of its attributes. Let $S_A \subset A$ be a subset of up to 3 attributes from $A$ (i.e. $1 \leq |S_A| \leq 3$). For an arbitrary record $r\in R$, by $r.a_k$ we define a value of $a_k$ for $r$, and by $r.S_A$ a collection of values of attributes in $S_A$ for $r$.
