# WebTeX

Web$\TeX$ is tool that helps with scientific and technical writing. It is based on Markdown, which introduces simple syntax to make things like headings, [links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink), and **bold** and _italic_ text. Web$\TeX$ extends Markdown by adding support for $\TeX$ math expressions, automatically numbered headings and figures, citations and cross-references.

## Markdown

Markdown is nice because it is very easy to read. You may have used Markdown before on sites like Reddit or GitHub. It lets you do things like this:

<Embed defaultValue=
{`_Italic_

**Bold**

## Math

Math works just like in $\LaTeX$, by wrapping it in $-symbols:

<Embed defaultValue=
{`Inline math: $e^{i\\pi} = -1$

And here is a math block:

$$
\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
$$`}
/>

Many $\TeX$ functions are supported, including macros using `\newcommand` etc. For a full list of supported functions, refer to the [KaTeX docs](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html).
