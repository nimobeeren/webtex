# WebTeX

Web$\TeX$ is tool that helps with scientific and technical writing. It builds on Markdown, which lets you do the basic formatting that you expect from any writing app. Web$\TeX$ extends Markdown by adding support for math expressions, citations, and cross-references.

## Basic formatting

To make things like headings, **bold** text, _italic_ text, and [links](#), you can use Markdown. You may have used Markdown before on sites like Reddit or GitHub.

It works like this:

<Embed defaultValue=
{`**Bold**

_Italic_

## Section

### Subsection

---

- Apples
- Oranges
- Pears

1. Eat
2. Sleep
3. Write
4. Repeat

---

> This is a quote.

---

Inline \`code\` with backticks

\`\`\`
Code blocks with triple backticks
\`\`\``}
/>

Web$\TeX$ supports everything in the [CommonMark spec](https://commonmark.org/).

## Math

Math works just like in $\LaTeX$, by wrapping it in $-signs:

<Embed defaultValue=
{`Inline math: $e^{i\\pi} = -1$

And here is a math block:

$$
\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
$$`}
/>

Many $\TeX$ functions are supported, including macros using `\newcommand` etc. For a full list of supported functions, refer to the [KaTeX docs](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html).

## Citations

## Cross-references

Figures and sections can be referenced using the `:ref[id]` command, where `id` is the ID of the element you want to reference. Before something can be referenced, it must have an ID. You can give something an ID using the `:id[your-id]` command.

For example, this is how you reference a figure:

<Embed defaultValue=
{`![Look at this graph!](/nickelback.jpg) :id[graph]

---

Now :ref[graph] is a reference to the figure.`}
/>

Referencing sections is even easier, because you don't have to give them an ID unless you want to. Check this out:

<Embed defaultValue=
{`## A section :id[first-section]

Some text.

## Another section

More text.

---

:ref[first-section] works.

And :ref[another-section] works too!`}
/>

‚ö†Ô∏è Be careful when referencing sections without giving them an ID. When you change the title of the section, the reference will break.

üí° You can find the ID of any section by hovering over the heading in the preview.

{/* TODO: this feels out of place */}
Headings and figures are automatically numbered. A heading with one `#` is not numbered, so this can be used as the title of the document.
