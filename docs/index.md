# WebTeX

Web$\TeX$ is tool that helps with scientific and technical writing. It is based on Markdown, which introduces simple syntax to make things like headings, [links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink), and **bold** and _italic_ text. Web$\TeX$ extends Markdown by adding support for $\TeX$ math expressions, automatically numbered headings and figures, citations and cross-references.
